                <AccordionContent className="text-[13px] text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Used engines can be a great deal. Consider the source -- if you are buying from a reputable dealer, you are likely to get a quality product. Used engines are rigorously examined before being sold, so their reliability is often far greater than expected.

                <AccordionContent className="text-[13px] text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Make sure the engine is compatible with your car. Check to see if the engine is in working order and that you are getting a reasonable price. Used engines are a great option for anyone looking to save money on car maintenance.

                <AccordionTrigger className="text-sm font-semibold text-foreground hover:text-primary">Which is better -- rebuilt or used engine?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent className="text-[13px] text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Although a used engine is less expensive, it may have greater wear and tear. The cost of a rebuilt engine is higher, but it will last longer. If you are looking to save money, a used engine is the best choice. If reliability is your primary priority, a rebuilt engine is a superior alternative.

                <AccordionContent className="text-[13px] text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Replacing your car engine is really worth your money and extends your vehicle life. Buying a used car engine is a wise investment. By choosing to buy a used engine, you avoid the production of a new engine, which is environmentally friendly. An engine replacement can also result in savings of taxes, license fees, and insurance costs.
